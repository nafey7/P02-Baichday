ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

<Any additional information that you would like me to know>

We have tried to implement asthetic improvements along the way but our main focus has been on use case functionality hence it might be a little difficult to navigate through the website. In the next sprint we will be focusing more towards the front end design.
